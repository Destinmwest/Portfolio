This assignment was a group project from my CMPT 341: Programming Languages course.

The goal of the assignment was to create a scanner and parser for a rudimentary programming language of our own design. We used Java along with JFlex to create the scanner for our language and CUP to generate our parser. In order to accomplish this assignment we had to understand and use regular expressions to create a grammer while also creating the rules for the semantics we desired for our language.

I chose this assignment for my portfolio because it gave me a deeper understanding of the programming languages I would be using in future projects as well as future careers I would be taking. Learning the syntax and semantics that determine the functionality of a language have been valuable in the broadest sense as I have progressed in the field on computer science.
 
In completing this assignment, I gained a deeper understanding of the concepts behind language design which in turn deepened my understanding of software design. I was also able to utilize critical thinking and creativity in designing the language along with collaboration in working with my team to achieve our goals.
